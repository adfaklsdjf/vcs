1.0.10: (2007-11-08)

       but height not
   * FEATURE: Allow explicitly disabling timestamps (-dt or --disable 
       timestamps)
   * FEATURE: Allow explicitly disabling shadows (-ds or --disable shadows)
   * Added HD resolution guessed aspect ratio (defaults to 16/9)
   * OTHER: Changed e-mail address in the comments to gmail's, would probably


1.0.9a: (2007-06-10) (-Brown bag- Bugfix release)
   * BUGFIX: Fixed regression introduced in 1.0.8a: unsetting numcols
       broke extended mode captures (Thanks to 'Aleksandar Urošević').
   * BUGFIX: Use the computed number of columns for extended mode
       (instead of the global one)

1.0.8a: (2007-06-02) (Bugfix release)
   * BUGFIX: User set number of columns wasn't being used if -n wasn't used
       (Thanks to 'Homer S').
   * BUGFIX: Right side of heading wasn't using the user's font colour
       (Thanks to 'Dougn Redhammer').

1.0.7a: (2007-05-12)
   * Print title *before* the highlights.
   * Added the forgotten -O and -c to the help text (oops!)
   * Experimental: Allow using non-latin alphabets by switching font. See -I.
       It only affects the filename! Also allow overriding the font to be used
       to print the filename ($font_filename). Right now only using a Mincho font,
       it can be overriding by overriding $FONT_MINCHO.
   * Make title font size independent of the timestamps size. And allow
       overriding the title font ($font_title), font size ($pts_title)
       and colours ($fg_title and $bg_title).
   * Allow overriding the previews' background ($bg_contact)
   * Added getopt, identify, sed, grep and egrep to the checked programs
   * BUGFIX: Corrected test of accepted characters for intervals
   * INTERNAL: New parsing code
   * FEATURE: Replaced hard by soft shadows
   * BUGFIX: Corrected console colour usage: Print the colours to the correct
       channel
   * Made tput (coloured console output) optional (AFAIK should be present in
       any sane system though).

       version), Photoframe and Random colours/fonts. (see --help)
   * INTERNAL: Use /dev/shm as base tempdir if possible
   * BUGFIX: Fixed safe_rename(): Don't assume current dir, added '--' to mv
   * Added workaround for ffmpeg arguments order
   * Allow getting the output of ffmpeg/mplayer (with $stdout and $stderr)
   * INTERNAL: Renamed info() to inf() to eliminate ambiguities
   * INTERNAL: guess_aspect() doesn't operate globally
   * Reorganized help by alphabetical/rarity order
   * FEATURE: Full milliseconds support (actually, full decimal point seconds),
       timecode format extended to support e.g. 3m.24 (which means 00:03:00.240)
   * BUGFIX/FEATURE: The number of extended captures is rounded to match the
       standard columns (extended width matches standard)
   * Made FOURCCs list case sensitive (the list has grown enough that I no
       longer see a benefit in being ambigous)
   * Added codec ids for On2's VP3, VP4, VP5 and VP6, TechSmith Screen Capture
       Codec (Camtasia's) and Theora, expanded list of FOURCCs of Indeo's
       codecs.
   * Added -E / --end_offset / $DEFAULT_END_OFFSET, used to eliminate some
       seconds from the end

     than video
   * Don't print the sucess line unless it was really successful
   * Allow quiet operation (-q and -qq), and different verbosity levels
     (only through config overrides)
   * Print vcs' identification on operation
   * FEATURE: Auto aspect ratio (-A, --autoaspect)
   * INTERNAL: Added better documentation of functions
   * Print coloured messages if possible (can be disabled by overriding
     $plain_messages)
   * FEATURE: Command line overrides (-O, --override)
   * BUGFIX: Don't allow setting -n0
   * Renamed codec ids of WMA2 (to WMA8) and WMA3 (to WMA9)
   * Changed audio codec ids from MPEG-1 to MPEG, as there's no difference,
     from mplayer's identification at least, between MPEG-1 and MPEG-2
   * Audio identified as MP2 can also actually be MP1, added it to the codec id
   * Added codec ids for: Vorbis, WMA7/WMA1, WMV1/WMV7, PCM, DivX ;),
     OpenDivX, LAVC MPEG-4, MSMPEG-4 family, M-JPEG, RealVideo family, I420,

     naming when the output file exists
   * Moved previous previous versions' changes to a separate file.
   * Support for per-dir and system-wide configuration files. Precedence
     in ascending order:
     /etc/vcs.conf ~/.vcs.conf ./vcs.conf
   * Added default_options (broken, currently ignored)
   * BUGFIX: (Apparently) Corrected the one-vidcap-less/more bug
   * Added codec ids of WMV9 and WMA3
